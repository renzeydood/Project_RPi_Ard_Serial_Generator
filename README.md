# Project_RPi_Ard_Serial_Generator
A Python script to generate simple serial libraries for Raspberry Pi and Arduino

## Background
The most common way for Raspberry Pi and Arduino to communicate is through the serial interface. Seperate codes are needed, 1 for the Arduino and another for the Raspberry Pi. Often, the issue is when 1 half or the other has some issues. Debugging the serial interface will then take a lot of time. Thus, this script will generate all the necessary codes for both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi to begin serial communications, making the process much easier.
